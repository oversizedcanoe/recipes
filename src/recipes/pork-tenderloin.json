Heat a pan over medium heat, add a thin layer of oil, and sear tenderloins on all sides.\n5. After ~5 minutes, transfer to an oven-safe dish (lined with aluminum foil for easy cleanup).\n6. Baste with some glaze.\n7. Bake for 15 minutes.\n8. Check internal temperature, aiming for 145°F (140°F is acceptable with carryover cooking).\n9. For the smaller tenderloin, check temperature first to avoid overcooking.\n10. Flip tenderloins, baste with more glaze, and return to oven for 8–10 minutes as needed.\n11. Continue checking, flipping, and basting until both reach 145°F. Remove the first done tenderloin if needed and hold.\n12.
