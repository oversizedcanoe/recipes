  "description": "Crispy, classic beer battered fish with a light, carbonated batter. Simple technique, great texture, and best served with lemon and tartar sauce.",
  "gist": "Flour and batter the fish. Fry it.",
  "ingredients": "Fish (thawed basa fillets cut in half; enough dredging for 3–4 full fillets)\n1 can beer (light beer works well)\n2 cups flour\n2 tbsp all-purpose seasoning plus salt\n1 egg\nOil for frying\nLemon wedge for serving",
  "steps": "1. Add 1 cup of flour to a plate for dredging.\n2. Add the remaining 1 cup of flour to a bowl along with the seasoning.\n3. Begin heating oil to 375°F (aiming to cook at 350°F).\n   - The oil should be almost at temperature when battering begins so the beer remains carbonated.\n4. Beat the egg and stir it into the seasoned flour.\n5. Slowly pour in the full can of beer, stirring gently.\n   - It will start as a clumpy, frothy mess but will smooth out after the full can is added.\n6. Dredge the fish in the plain flour, coating lightly.\n7. Coat the fish thoroughly in the batter.\n8. Fry for 5–8 minutes until golden and cooked through.\n9. Serve with a lemon wedge.",
