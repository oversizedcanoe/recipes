This is a collection of my favourite recipes. None of these are of my own creation, but are instead an amalgamation of several different recipes from different authors, video creators, chefs, and influencers. I will do my best to credit the person/people who most influenced a recipe, but some of my go-to sources are:

 - [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea)
 - [Internet Shaquille](https://www.youtube.com/@internetshaquille)
 - [Ethan Chlebowski](https://www.youtube.com/@EthanChlebowski)
 - [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezAlt)
 - [Matty Matheson](https://www.youtube.com/@mattymatheson)
 - [Binging with Babish](https://www.youtube.com/@bingingwithbabish)
 - [Steve at Vivaldi](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveatVivaldi)

 Most recipes will be outlined twice. The first is the "high-level idea of what to do" version. The second is more specific. When I first try a recipe, I like to follow it to a T, to get an accurate representation of how the final dish should look at taste. However, eventually, I want to cook without constantly staring at my Notes app trying to get every detail perfect. Personally, there is no better feeling than knowing the general idea of a recipe and executing it on the fly perfectly. Okay, there are probably better feelings, but that's up there.

 Once I've followed a recipe and made a dish a couple times, I like to boil down the recipe into a few sentences. Next time I want to make the dish, I can skim this outline and remember the general idea, and roll with it. I have a terrible memory, so having this quick reminder helps ease my anxiety of forgetting something crucial.

 Enjoy.
