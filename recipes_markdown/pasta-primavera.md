## Pasta Primavera
Just veggies and noodles. However, I will often cook chicken thighs in the pan before putting the veggies in and slice the chicken on top of the pasta at the end. I guess it's no longer primavera at that point. 

### The Gist
Sautee a bunch of veggies in a pan in order of how long they take to cook. Add splashes of stock or wine if you want near the end. Toss pasta + pasta water in.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Any vegetables you want. My favourites are zucchini, broccoli stalks, red onion, and garlic, but you could really use anything. Snow peas, peppers (hot or not), tomatoes (I'd do cherry or sundried), kalamalata olives, spinach, carrots, asparagus, brussels sprouts, peas
 - Any pasta you want, but I'd focus on a chunky pasta rather than a stringy one. I.e. penne or rigatoni over spaghetti or linguini. Since this dish is mostly pieces of vegetable rather than a smooth sauce, you want noodles you can stick a fork in, not twirl up.
 - Lemon juice
 - Optionally, stock or white wine for deglazing
 - Optionally, parmesan

#### Steps
1. Begin boiling your water.
2. Chop your vegetables up. 
    - How you chop them up depends on what they are. You want roughly bite size pieces, but also consider how long they take to cook. For something thick and dense like a carrot or brussel sprout, consider shaving them or chopping finely. For more average vegetables like onion, pepper, and zucchini, bite size pieces are fine.
3. Heat up a pan with some oil.
4. One by one, add your veggies to the pan, starting with the longest cooking vegetables.
5. If anything starts to stick or burn, turn the heat down and deglaze with stock or wine. Feel free to add more stock/wine throughout the process, but you can use pasta water instead too.
6. Once the veggies are almost done, boil the noodles, taking them out a minute or two before they are done.
   - For example, if the package says 10 minutes, add the noodles to the water when there is ~10 minutes left on the vegetables. That way everything finishes cooking together. Use your judgement. It's better to have to take the veggies off the heat for a bit rather than drain the pasta and set aside while you cook the veggies for 10 more minutes.
7. A few minutes before adding the noodles, add the garlic. It's nice to keep it only lightly cooked.
8. Toss the almost-cooked noodles in the pan with some pasta water.
9. At this point you can grate parmesan on and begin tossing/stirring, emulsifying the pasta water (add more if necessary) with the cheese, oil, wine, stock, into a light but creamy sauce.
10. Finish with a squirt of lemon juice.
