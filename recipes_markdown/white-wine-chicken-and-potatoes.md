## RECIPE_NAME
Adapted from [here](https://gatherednutrition.com/white-wine-skillet-chicken-and-potatoes/). Very similar to [chicken gnocchi soup](./chicken-gnocchi-soup.md). This is a one pan meal, so I recommend using the biggest pan you have.

### The Gist
Chicken, mirepoix and potatoes, herbs, wine, stock, simmer, cream, spinach.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Chicken (I recommend thighs)
 - 1/4-1/2 a white onion
 - Potatoes (bag of baby potatoes cut in half, or a few yellow potatoes chopped into large bite size pieces)
 - Carrots (equal amount to the potatoes, chopped into large bite size pieces)
 - Garlic
 - Herbs
 - 1/2c white wine
 - 1/2c chicken stock
 - Heavy cream
 - Corn starch slurry
 - Optionally, spinach and/or lemon

#### Steps
1. Chop chicken into bite size pieces.
  - Chicken stock is almost always salty enough on it's own, meaning hold off on salting the chicken. You can add any or all of the seasonings from my [all purpose seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md), but I usually keep the chicken plain here. The stock, wine, herbs, and garlic on their own provide the backbone of the flavour here.
2. Sear off chicken in a large pan.
   - The reason I recommend chopping *before* searing is simple: more surface area for browning = more flavour.
3. Remove chicken once browned (doesn't need to be cooked) and add the onion, potatoes, carrots, and garlic, as well as salt and pepper. Go easy on the salt for the same reason as the chicken.
4. Cook until the onions go translucent and things have picked up some colour.
5. Deglaze with the white wine.
6. Turn the heat up, reducing the wine down to 1/3, scraping up any brown bits.
7. Add the herbs, chicken, and chicken stock. Ensure there is enough liquid in the pan to cook the potatoes and carrots, but not too much that you have a soup.
8. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, checking then and every 5 minutes thereafter for the doneness of the chicken, potatoes, and carrots.
9. Once cooked, add a splash of cream and a handful of spinach. If you want a thicker sauce, add a 1-2 tbsp of cornstarch slurry and let cook for another minute or two.
10. Optionally, garnish with a lemon wedge.
