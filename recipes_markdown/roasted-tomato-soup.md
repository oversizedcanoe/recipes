### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - A ton of tomatoes. Roma are best, but I like using a variety, including some grape/cherry. You could use canned San Marzano in a pinch, but you may have skip the "roasting" part.
 - A head or two of garlic
 - Red onion, maybe a half
 - Optionally, tomato paste.
 - Stock of some sort
 - Heavy cream

#### Steps
1. Optionally, peel your tomatoes. Watch a video on the blanching method.
2. Preheat your oven to 450.
3. Roughly chop all your vegetables. Since it's being blended, you can keep things big. As long as the inside is exposed to heat, you're good.
   - Chop the garlic head in half. We want to keep the "shell" of the head in tact so nothing burns.
   - Make sure you do cut the cherry/grape tomatoes if using them so they don't explode in the oven.
7. Arrange all the vegetables on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
8. Bake for 20 minutes.
9. Remove from oven to mix things around. Some heavy browning is okay, and if anything is starting to burn, it can be discared later. If the pan is full of liquid, you can pour it out into a bowl and add it back to the soup before blending (or not).
10. Continue baking and mixing in intervals of 10 minutes until everything is nicely roasted.
11. Near the end, optionally add a few tbsp of tomato paste and let roast for a few minutes.
12. Remove any burn bits and set the garlic head halves aside.
13. Dump the tray into a pot.
14. Squeeze the garlic bulbs out from the heads.
15. Simmer over medium heat for a few more minutes.
16. Add a cup or two of stock (chicken, vegetable, beef, anything).
17. Begin blending with a stick blender, adding more stock as needed to achieve desired consistency.
18. Season to taste with salt and pepper
19. Finish with a drizzle of heavy cream.
