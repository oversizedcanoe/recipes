### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - 1 pack bacon
 - 1 pack smokies
 - 2-3 tbsp Brown sugar
 - 2-3 tbsp [all purpose seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md), with some chili powder and pepper
 
#### Steps
1. Preheat oven to 400.
2. Dry off all the smokies.
3. Cut the bacon pack into 3.
4. Mix the seasoning with the brown sugar. 
5. Wrap each smokie in a bacon strip and place in an oven safe dish.
   - All times I have made these, I packed them tightly next to eachother, and while they were amazing, the bottom didn't crisp up to my liking. I might try spacing them out a bit to leave room for evaporation.
   - You could also potentially put these on a rack in a baking dish so that they can get heat underneath them.
   - Or you could maybe flip halfway through, or even flip + broil for a minute at the end, but be extra mindful they don't burn.
6. Sprinkle the seasoing over all the smokies.
7. Bake for 20 min and check. Continue baking and checking every 5 minutes until the bacon is cripsy, ensuring it does not burn.
