## Fried Chicken
Juicy, flavourful fried chicken. This recipe is great because of how easy the dredge is: mix flour with enough water to create a pancake-batter consistency.

### The Gist
Season the chicken. Dredge it in flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and more spices. Fry it around 375 until golden brown.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Chicken in whatever form you want
 - 1.5c flour
 - 1/2c corn starch
 - 1tbsp baking powder
 - [All Purpose Seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md) plus salt and cayenne
 - Water
 - Neutral oil for frying (vegetable, canola, etc)

#### Steps
1. Cut the chicken into strips or chunks/nuggets. Use breasts or thighs or wings, doesn't matter.
2. Place the chicken in a large bowl, as the dredging liquid will be made in this bowl alongside the chicken.
3. Season the chicken with [All Purpose Seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md) as well as salt and cayenne.
4. In a bowl, combine 1c flour, cornstarch, baking powder, more [All Purpose Seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md), salt, and cayenne. Set aside.
5. In the bowl with the chicken, combine the remaining 1/2c flour and more seasoning. Slowly add water (maybe 2tbsp at a time) until it is the consistency of pancake mix. It should stick to the chicken, not drip off.
6. One piece at a time, take the chicken and drop it in the first flour bowl. Squeeze the seasoned flour into the chicken.
7. Begin heating your pan/pot for deep frying. We want to fry at 350, but to account for the temp drop when we put the chicken in, wait until the oil is at 375.
8. Fry in batches until golden brown and fully cooked, probably 5-8 minutes depending on how big the chunks are.
