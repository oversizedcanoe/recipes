### The Gist
Smash balls of beef on really hot cast iron.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - ~6oz lean ground beef per serving/person. I've tried medium, it's too messy. Extra lean is not fatty enough.
 - Buns of choice
 - Optionally, cheese slices 
 - Butter
 - Salt + Pepper

#### Steps
1. Form the ground beef into 3oz balls (about the size of a tangerine).
2. Butter each side of the buns and toast them in a pan. Get all the buns ready first as the burgers only take ~90 seconds to cook each.
3. Crank the heat up in a cast iron pan. Once smoking, add your beef balls. Cook in multiples of two, because these will be doubles.
4. Smash the patty as flat as possible.
5. Season with salt and pepper (and MSG if you're frisky).
6. Once liquid starts squeezing out the top of the patty and the underside smells like it's on the verge of burning, scrape and flip. This should take maybe one minute. 
7. Season the next side and add cheese. 
8. Once cheese is melty, the underside is probably cooked. The 2nd side only takes 30-60 seconds.
9. During this time, get your buns dressed (seriously, make the [burger sauce](./burger-sauce.md)).
10. Scrape patties off and build the burger. 
11. I recommend keeping it simple with just the [burger sauce](./burger-sauce.md) and optionally cheese. If you're adding another topping, I really recommend going easy on it: the highlight is the meat and sauce. A few pickled jalapenos or some finely shredded lettuce at most, personally.
