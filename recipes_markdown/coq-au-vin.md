## Coq Au Vin
There's a lot of good cooking techniques in this dish, but overall, it is not that hard. Using bone in dark meat means the chicken is basically bullet proof time-wise, and the resulting sauce is so savoury it could make a flip flop taste good.

### The Gist
Sear then braise chicken in a delicious sauce made from wine/roux/vegetables/chicken stock.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Chicken. Ideally big pieces of bone in, skin on, dark meat. Think leg quarters and thighs
 - Bacon/pork belly, or technically "lardon"
 - Pearl onions
 - Mushrooms
 - Garlic
 - 2-3tbsp tomato paste
 - Flour and Butter, for a roux
 - 1c Red wine
 - 1-2c chicken stock
 - Any herbs (i.e. Herbs de provence), maybe 2tbsp total
 - Rice or egg noodles for serving

#### Steps
1. If using chicken quarters, break down into legs and thighs.
2. Chop bacon into small pieces.
3. Peel the pearl onion and chop the mushrooms up into bite size pieces. The mushrooms shrink, so keep them fairly chunky.
4. Place the bacon in a cold, large pan, and turn the heat on low.
5. Let the bacon completely render and remove from pan once cooked.
6. Turn the heat up and sear the chicken nicely.
7. Remove the chicken. Leave ~1tbsp of fat in the pan and remove/set aside any extra.
8. Add the onions and mushrooms in the pan to get some color, adding the garlic part way through.
9. Turn the heat down and melt a few tbsp of butter in the pan.
10. Sprinkle a few tbsp of flour in the pan, creating a roux.
11. Squeeze a few tbsp of tomato paste and start to caramelize it.
12. When everything is on the verge of burning, pour in 1 cup of red wine, and deglaze.
13. Reduce the wine to 1/3, scraping all the fond off.
14. Add the herbs and return the bacon to the pan.
15. Add 1 cup of chicken stock and stir everything together.
16. Place the chicken in the pan, skin side up, and add more chicken stock until almost covered. 
17. Cover the pan and simmer gently for ~an hour, checking after 45 minutes (this is a good point to start boiling water for rice/noodles/getting any other sides ready).
19. Once the chicken is fall apart tender, remove it from the pan.
20. If there is a ton of fat pooled in the sauce, you can spoon/sop some of it up, leaving some.
21. Reduce the sauce for 5-10 minutes while letting the chicken rest. 
22. Serve the chicken and sides on a plate, spooning the vegetables and sauce over everything.
