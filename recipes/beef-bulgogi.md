## Beef Bulgogi
I don't think I ever follow the recipe on this one. I usually just follow "the gist", which is why I love this meal.

### The Gist
Brown off ground beef. Add vegetables (at a minimum, onion and garlic). Add some asian-inspired flavourings (at a minimum, soy sauce and sesame oil). Cook for a few minutes. Add frozen peas at the end if you want. Serve on rice.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - 1/3c soy sauce
 - 2tbsp rice wine vinegar
 - 2tsp brown sugar
 - 2tsp sesame oil
 - 1tsp minced fresh ginger
 - 1tsp minced garlic
 - Veggies of choice
   - My preference is onion and frozen peas. 

#### Steps
1. Cook the ground beef halfway through.
2. Add the vegetables. If using peas, hold off til the end.
3. Mix soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, and sesame oil together.
   -  Most of the time I'll just do soy, sesame, fish sauce and oyster sauce
   -  Optionally, add a corn starch slurry
4. When the beef and veggies are almost done, add the sauce.
5. Once the sauce is mixed in and thickened up, add frozen peas if you want.
6. Serve over rice, garnishing with sesame seeds and/or green onions.
