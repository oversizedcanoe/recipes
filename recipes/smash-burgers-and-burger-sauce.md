## Smash Burgers and Burger Sauce
The best way to make burgers.

The burger sauce is from Joshua Weissman's video on In N Out sauce.

### Core Idea
Smash balls of beef on really hot cast iron.

The sauce doesn't really have a "core idea". I recommend making it to a T, though. It's perfect. It's enough for 6+ burgers easily.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - ~6oz lean ground beef per serving/person. I've tried medium, it's too messy. Extra lean is not fatty enough.
 - Buns of choice
 - Optionally, cheese slices 
 - Butter
 - 1 large sweet onion
   - Alternatively, 1-2 tbsp of caramelized onions from a jar. I 100% recommend this instead. Mixed in a sauce like this, the difference is negligible and saves you 1+ hour of time caramelizing onions.
 - 90g mayo
 - 65g ketchup
 - 30g yellow mustard
 - 1 finely diced dill pickle
 - 6g Worchestershire, about 1/2 tbsp
 - 1 garlic clove grated or pressed
 - Salt + Pepper

#### Steps
1. Mix together mayo, ketchup, mustard, worchestershire.
2. Add the caramelized onion, pickle, and garlic.
3. Add salt and pepper to taste.
4. Form the ground beef into 3oz balls (about the size of a tangerine).
5. Butter each side of the buns and toast them in a pan. These need to be ready to go because the burgers only take ~90 seconds to cook each.
6. Crank the heat up in a cast iron pan. Once smoking, add your beef balls. Cook in multiples of two, because these will be doubles.
7. Smash the patty as flat as possible.
8. Season with salt and pepper (and MSG if you're frisky).
9. Once liquid starts squeezing out the top of the patty and the underside smells like it's on the verge of burning, scrape and flip. This should take maybe one minute. 
10. Season the next side and add cheese. 
11. Once cheese is melty, the underside is probably cooked. The 2nd side only takes 30-60 seconds.
12. During this time, sauce up both sides of the bun.
13. Scrape patties off and build the burger. 
14. I recommend keeping it simple with just the sauce and optionally cheese. If you're adding another topping, I really recommend going easy on it: the highlight is the meat and sauce. A few pickled jalapenos or some finely shredded lettuce at most, personally.
