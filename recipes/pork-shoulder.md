### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - 4-5lb pork shoulder
 - 3/4c extra virgin olive oil
 - 3/4c orange juice
 - 1/2c lime juice
 - 8 garlic cloves, smashed
 - 1/2tbsp dried oregano
 - 2tsp ground cumin
 - 1tsp salt
 - 1tsp pepper

#### Steps
1. Mix eveverything together in a large ziploc bag.
2. Marinate for 12-24 hours.
3. Remove from fridge 1 hour before cooking.
4. Ensure there is a rack on the bottom position of your oven.
5. Preheat oven to 425.
6. Remove meat from marinade and wipe off any large chunks of garlic.
7. Place meat on an oven safe cooling rack on an aluminium foil linded baking sheet.
   - This allows the hot air to reach under the meat as well, maximizing caramelization.
8. Bake for 30 minutes.
9. Remove from oven and lower to heat 375.
10. You are aiming for a total cook time (at 375) of 90-120 minutes, or 120-150 minutes total.
11. Baste the meat with the pan drippings now and every 30 minutes until cooked.
12. Begin checking the temp after the meat after the 90 minute mark (which should be after 4 bastings).
13. After the 90 minute mark I suggest temping after every 10-15 minutes.
14. Aim for a final temperature of 160.
15. For reference, a 4.75lb shoulder took 110 minutes at 375, for a total cook time of 140 minutes.
16. Once done, rest on a plate, lightly covered with foil.

#### Notes
You could also cook at 320 for 3.5 for a "pulled pork" consistency.
