### Red Sauce
A simple but delicious tomato sauce.

#### Core Idea
Sautee onion, garlic, tomato paste, herbs and spices. Add tomatoes and simmer for a while.

#### Recipe
##### Ingredients
This is a really flexible recipe. You could double or halve basically any ingredient and it will still taste great. I also recommend doubling this recipe and freezing half.

 - 1/4 cup olive oil
 - Half a large onion, or a whole small one. White, Yellow, or Spanish
 - 4-6 cloves garlic
 - 1-2tbsp tomato paste
 - 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes
 - Any or all spices: Garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, chili flakes, oregano, thyme, rosemary. 1-2 tsp is a good start for basically everything.
 - Pinch of white sugar
 - Optional: fresh basil leaves, parmesan cheese rind

##### Steps
1. Dice the onion.
2. Smash the garlic cloves. I keep them fairly large, as this cooks forever and biting into a big piece isn't too overpowering in the end dish
3. Preheat a large pan and add olive oil. Keep the heat medium low. You want a decent amount of oil in the pan -- you're not deep frying anything, but the oil itself becomes part of the sauce itself as it emulsifies.
4. Add onions are garlic and sautee. They should sizzle but we're not looking for a ton of browning, just a long slow simmer in the oil, maybe 5-10 minutes.
5. Add a good pinch of salt and pepper.
6. Once the aromatics begin to soften up, add any fat-soluble spices (i.e. paprila and chili flakes).
7. Squeeze in tomato paste at the same time.
8. Continue sauteeing, letting the tomato paste get a bit brown.
9. Once things are getting close to browning, dump in the tomatoes. 
10. Rinse the tomato can and pour the remaining bits and the water into the pan. Don't worry if it's a lot of water, this is cooking for a while.
11. Add any of the remaining spices. I like garlic and onion powder, and some sort of italian blend or Herbs de Province.
12. Optionally, add any basil leaves and/or parmesan rind.
13. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil and simmer for at least 45 minutes, ideally 2-3 hours. If it ever gets too dry, add a splash of water. You could probably simmer on medium/medium-high for 20 minutes, no lid, stirring very often and get a good result, but overall, the longer the better.
14. Taste near the end and add tweak flavour profile with whatever is missing: sugar, salt.
15. Optionally, use a stick blender to smooth out the sauce. Keep it chunky, or blend it a bit, or blend it smooth, up to you.
16. Serve with pasta of your choice, I like linguini. I cook the noodles 1-2 minutes less than the box recommends, then I strain (reserving some pasta water), and toss 1-2 portions at a time in a separate pan, adding a ladel or two of sauce and some pasta water to finish cooking the noodles and emulsify everything together.
