### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Fish. I used thawed basa fillets cut in half. There is enough dredging for 3-4 full fillets
 - 1 can beer. I used light beer but you could experiment.
 - 2c flour
 - 2tbsp [all purpose seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md) plus salt
 - 1 egg
 - Oil for frying
 - Lemon wedge for serving (don't skip this part)

#### Steps
1. Add 1c flour to a plate for dredging.
2. Add the remaining 1c flour to a boil along with the seasoning.
3. Begin heating oil to 375 (aiming to cook at 350).
   - We want the oil to be almost at temp when we begin battering the fish, as we want the batter to still be carbonated from the beer.
4. Beat the egg and stir into the spiced flour bowl.
5. Slowly pour in a full can of beer and stir gently.
   - At first it will be a terrible clumpy frothy mess, but after the whole can and some stirring it will come together into a nice batter.
6. Add the fish to the plain flour, coating it completely in a light layer.
7. Add the fish to the batter, coating it completely in a thick layer.
8. Fry for 5-8 minutes.
9. Serve with a lemon wedge.
