## Pork Tenderloin
Juicy, flavorful pork tenderloin. This recipe is basically what's made in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUaGUC1a5fo) video.

### Core Idea
Season with [everything seasoning](./everything-seasoning.md) and sear pork in a pan. Make a glaze with brown sugar, hot sauce, garlic, mustard, and soy sauce. Baste and transfer to oven at 375 for 25-45 minutes, checking and basting after 15.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Pork tenderloins (come in packs of two)
 - Neutral oil, maybe 1-2tbsp
 - Spice rub
   - 1tsp each paprika, garlic powder, onion powder
   - 1/2tsp each thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper
 - Glaze
   - 4 cloves of garlic, minced
   - 1/4 cup honey
     - Or, 1/4 cup brown sugar. I never have honey so I usually do this.
   - 1tbsp hot sauce such as sriracha
   - 3tbsp soy sauce
   - 1tbsp mustard

#### Steps
1. Preheat oven to 375.
2. Separately, make spice rub and glaze.
3. Pat tenderloins dry and rub them down with neutral oil and coat with spice rub.
4. Heat a pan on medium. Once hot, add a thin layer of oil and place tenderloins in pan.
5. Brown on all sides. 
6. After ~5 minutes in the pan, transfer to an oven safe dish (I recommend lining with aluminimum foil to help with cleanup).
7. Baste some of the glaze over the tenderloins.
8. Bake in oven for 15 minutes.
9. After 15 minutes, temp the tenderloins, aiming for 145 (140 is okay with carry over). 
10. Note that there is usually one smaller tenderloin, so check the temp on that first as is it more liable to overcook.
11. If more time is needed (it definitely will be), flip tenderloins and baste with more glaze, and return to the oven for 8-10 minutes.
12. Continue checking, flipping, and basting until they reach 145. If one reaches 145 first, remove it from the pan and hold on a plate outside the oven. Typically the small one will take 1-2 flips and the larger one 2-3 more.
13. Once they are both at 145, remove the pan from the oven, place the other tenderloin back in the pan, and cover with alumimum foil for 10 minutes to rest.
