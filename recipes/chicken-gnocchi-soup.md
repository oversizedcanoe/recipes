### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Chicken
 - Mire poix (onion, celery, carrot) and garlic
 - 2-3tbsp Butter
 - 2-3tbsp flour
 - Any herbs, dry or fresh
 - Chicken stock, probably 1-1.5l depending on how much of everything else you have
   - For a creamier version, you can use roughly 2 parts stock, 1 part milk, 1 part cream 
 - Gnocchi
 - Heavy cream
 - Spinach
 - Optionally, cooked and crumbled bacon

#### Steps
1. Chop chicken up into bite size pieces.
   - Chicken stock is almost always salty enough on it's own, meaning hold off on salting the chicken. You can add any or all of the seasonings from my [all purpose seasoning](./all-purpose-seasoning.md), but I usually keep the chicken plain here. The stock, herbs, and garlic on their own provide the backbone of the flavour here.
2. Dice veggies.
3. If using dark meat, I suggest searing the chicken first, then removing from the pot. If using white meat, keep aside for now.
4. Add oil and sautee veggies on low heat.
5. Once fragrant and softened, add butter, melt, and flour, stirring to create a roux.
6. Add chicken stock. You can always add more later, so don't dump the whole thing in.
7. At this point you can (and should) use a stick blender to blend the soup until thick.
8. Add the herbs.
9.  Add your chicken to (or back to) the pot and simmer until cooked.
10. Add gnocchi and continue simmering until cooked (only takes a few minutes).
11. If you used straight stock for the broth, add a splash of heavy cream at this point. Ensure the soup boils a bit after adding the cream so it can thicken.
12. Add a few handfuls of spinach.
13. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
14. Serve and optionally add crumbled bacon on top.
