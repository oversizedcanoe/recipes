## Burger Sauce
From Joshua Weissman's video on In N Out sauce. It's enough for 6+ burgers easily.

### The Gist
The sauce doesn't really have a "The Gist". I recommend making it to a T, though. It's perfect.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - 1 large sweet onion
   - Alternatively, 1-2 tbsp of caramelized onions from a jar. I 100% recommend this instead. Mixed in a sauce like this, the difference is negligible and saves you 1+ hour of time caramelizing onions.
 - 90g mayo
 - 65g ketchup
 - 30g yellow mustard
 - 1 finely diced dill pickle
 - 6g Worchestershire, about 1/2 tbsp
 - 1 garlic clove grated or pressed
 - Salt + Pepper

#### Steps
1. Mix together mayo, ketchup, mustard, worchestershire.
2. Add the caramelized onion, pickle, and garlic.
3. Add salt and pepper to taste.
4. Taste and adjust seasoning.
