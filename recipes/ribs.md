## Ribs
Ribs. I think this is basically Matty Mathesons recipe for his McRib ribs.

### Core Idea
Coat ribs in mustard and spices. 2.5 hours covered at 300, then 30 minutes at 350 uncovered, slathering BBQ sauce on every 10 minutes.

### Detailed Recipe
#### Ingredients
 - Two racks of pork back ribs
 - Yellow mustard (enough to coat all ribs in a light layer)
 - Seasoning blend of choice. I used some generic smokey barbeque one, but you could make one with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder.
 - Barbeque sauce

#### Steps
1. Preheat oven to 300.
2. Cut off any silver skin from the ribs if necessary.
3. Slather yellow mustard all over the ribs. It's not really for flavor, just enough on there to act as a glue for the seasoning.
4. Cover in seasoning. Go heavy.
5. Completely seal ribs in aluminum foil.
6. Bake for 2.5 hours.
7. Remove ribs from oven, turn up to 350.
8. Uncover ribs and baste with the fat drippings and slather BBQ sauce on.
9. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes.
10. Repeat the two steps above 2 more times, for a total of 30 minutes uncovered and 3 "slatherings".
11. Rest uncovered for 5 minutes out of the oven.
